        Right now I’m focused on leveling up my professional skills. I write
        code with an emphasis on clarity, maintainability, and solid
        architecture. My current stack revolves around Node + TypeScript on the
        backend and React on the frontend, with MySQL as my main database. I’ve
        also been studying design patterns, query optimization, service
        organization, and API best practices. My goal is to build applications
        that aren’t just functional, but durable — code that stays clean and
        reliable months down the line.
